goat3d
------
A 3D scene, character, and animation file format specification, library, and tools.

main project site: http://code.google.com/p/goat3d/

Goat3D is a hierarchical 3D scene, character, and animation file format set,
targeting mostly real-time applications (such as games). The goat3d
specification defines 2 complimentary file formats:
 * The main goat3d file format defines meshes, lights, cameras, environmental
   parameters, materials, and transformation hierarchies.
 * The animation file format defines a sequence of keyframes and interpolation
   parameters, for any number of nodes, defined in the main scene file.


This project provides the specification of the file formats, a simple library
with a clean C API for reading and writing files in the goat3d scene and
animation file formats, as well as a number of tools dealing with such files.

Specifically, at the moment (early development stage), the following are
included in various degrees of completion:
 * *libgoat3d*, a library for reading and writing goat3d scene and animation files.
 * *maxgoat*, a goat3d scene and animation exporter for autodesk 3dsmax 2014.
 * *ass2goat*, a universal 3D asset conversion utility based on the excellent
   assimp library, from a huge number of 3D file formats to the goat3d file
   format.
 * *goatview*, a 3D scene and animation preview tool, based on OpenGL.
 * *goatprim*, a procedural 3D model (primitive) generator for quick testing.

The following are planned for the near future:
 * *blendgoat*, an exporter for Blender.
