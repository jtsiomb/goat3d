Goat3D animation file format v2
-------------------------------

Changes from v1
---------------
With the move from XML to treestore files, many things which were previously
child nodes of track, changed to attributes of the track node. Also the "attr"
field which defined the usage of each track, changed into a type node with
explicit keyframe types.
In Goat3D v2, the animations can be separate files, or part of the goat3d scene
file hierarchy. See ANIM in goatfmt.

Chunk structure
---------------
Multiple tracks might apply to the same node, to allow for different
interpolation, extrapolation, and time ranges between position, rotation, and
scaling tracks.

Names in capital letters are nodes.
Names in lower case are node attributes.
Leaf nodes which carry actual data are marked with (type). Where choice is
involved, options are seperated with the | symbol.

NOTE1: The track type can be a pre-defined usage, which implies a keyframe type,
or it can be a generic track, defined by the keyframe type.
The generic types are:
    - "val": keys are scalar values.
    - "vec3": keys are 3d vectors.
    - "vec4": keys are 4d vectors.
    - "quat": keys are quaternions, "linear" interpolation implies slerp.
The pre-defined usage types should be used for all position/rotation/scaling
tracks, and are the following:
    - "pos": position keys of type "vec3".
    - "rot": rotation keys of type "quat".
    - "scale": scaling keys of type "vec3".
