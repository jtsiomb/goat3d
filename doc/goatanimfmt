Goat3D animation file format

Chunk structure
---------------
Multiple tracks might apply to the same node, to allow for different
interpolation, extrapolation, and time ranges between position, rotation, and
scaling tracks.

ANIM
 +--ANIM_NAME

 +--TRACK
     +--TRACK_NAME
     |   +--<STRING>
     +--TRACK_NODE
     |   +--<STRING>	(name of the scene node using this track)
     +--TRACK_ATTR
     |   +--<STRING>	(specify the attribute affected, see NOTE1)
     +--TRACK_INTERP
     |   +--<STRING>    ("step", "linear", "cubic")
     +--TRACK_EXTRAP
     |   +--<STRING>	("extend", "clamp", "repeat", "pingpong")
     +--TRACK_KEY
         +--TRACK_KEY_TIME
         |   +--<INT>	(time in milliseconds)
         +--TRACK_KEY_VALUE
             +--<FLOAT|FLOAT3|FLOAT4>

NOTE1: The attribute might be any user-defined string, but the following
standard attribute names are specified:
 - "position" keys are (x,y,z) vectors
 - "rotation" keys are (x,y,z,w) quaternions, with w being the real part
 - "scaling" keys are (x,y,z) scale factors
